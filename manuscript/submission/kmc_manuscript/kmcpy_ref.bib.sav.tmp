	abstract = {The development of inexpensive batteries based on magnesium (Mg) chemistry will contribute remarkably toward developing high-energy-density storage systems that can be used worldwide. Significant challenges remain in developing practical Mg batteries, the chief of which is designing materials that can provide facile transport of Mg. In this review, we cover the experimental and theoretical methods that can be used to quantify Mg mobility in a variety of host frameworks, the specific transport quantities that each technique is designed to measure or calculate, and some practical examples of their applications. We then list the unique challenges faced by different experimental and computational techniques in probing Mg ion transport in materials. This review concludes with an outlook on the directions that the scientific community could soon pursue as we strive to construct a pragmatic Mg battery.},

First-principles simulations play an important role in this quest. Yet, these methods are generally computationally-intensive, with limited access to complex, low-symmetry structures, such as interfaces. Here we show how topological analysis of the procrystal electron density can be applied to efficiently mitigate this issue. We discuss how this methodology goes beyond current state of the art capabilities and demonstrate this with two examples. In the first, we examine Li-ion transport across grain boundaries in Li3ClO electrolyte. Then, we compute diffusion coefficients as a function of charge carrier concentration in spinel LiTiS2 electrode material. These two case studies do not exhaust the opportunities and might constitute motivations for still more complex applied materials.},

This contribution reviews statistical mechanics approaches that connect a crystal's electronic structure to its thermodynamic and kinetic properties. We start with a description of a thermodynamic and kinetic framework for multicomponent crystals that integrates chemistry and mechanics, as well as nonconserved order parameters that track the degree of chemical order and group/subgroup structural distortions. The framework allows for spatial heterogeneities and naturally couples thermodynamics with kinetics. We next survey statistical mechanics approaches that rely on effective Hamiltonians to treat configurational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom within multicomponent crystals. These Hamiltonians, when suitably constructed, are capable of extrapolating first-principles electronic structure calculations within (kinetic) Monte Carlo simulations, thereby enabling first-principles predictions of equilibrium and nonequilibrium materials properties at finite temperature.},

          , 
            
              To date, battery research largely follows an “Edisonian” approach based on experimental trial-and-error in contrast to a systematic strategy of design-of-experiments. Battery interfaces are arguably the most important yet the least understood components of energy storage devices. To transform the way we perform battery research, theory and computations can be used simultaneously to understand and guide the design of meaningful and targeted experiments. However, it is well known that modelling of battery interfaces is computationally prohibitive in terms of both resources and time due to the large size of systems to provide realistic and descriptive models. Recently, automated and intelligent
              in silico
              tools have been developed to accelerate the description of materials, such as workflows designed to generate, handle and analyse hundreds of thousands of materials data and at different scales. Here, we assess the latest computational strategies, outline unresolved questions, and propose future directions that will guide and drive future developments of interfaces in energy storage devices. The future directions include the development of complementary experimental techniques, such as high-throughput automated materials synthesis,

          , 
            We propose a novel statistical learning framework for automatically and efficiently building reduced kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) models of large-scale elementary reaction networks from data generated by a single or few molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Existing approaches for identifying species and reactions from molecular dynamics typically use bond length and duration criteria, where bond duration is a fixed parameter motivated by an understanding of bond vibrational frequencies. In contrast, we show that for highly reactive systems, bond duration should be a model parameter that is chosen to maximize the predictive power of the resulting statistical model. We demonstrate our method on a high temperature, high pressure system of reacting liquid methane, and show that the learned KMC model is able to extrapolate more than an order of magnitude in time for key molecules. Additionally, our KMC model of elementary reactions enables us to isolate the most important set of reactions governing the behavior of key molecules found in the MD simulation. We develop a new data-driven algorithm to reduce the chemical reaction network which can be solved either as an integer program or efficiently using L1 regularization, and compare our results with simple count-based reduction. For our liquid methane system, we discover that rare reactions do not play a significant role in the system, and find that less than 7\% of the approximately 2000 reactions observed from molecular dynamics are necessary to reproduce the molecular concentration over time of methane. The framework described in this work paves the way towards a genomic approach to studying complex chemical systems, where expensive MD simulation data can be reused to contribute to an increasingly large and accurate genome of elementary reactions and rates.},

Nucleation rate theory[1‐3] has been successfully used to describe metal heteroepitaxy [4] and qualitatively explained the initial stage of oxidation behavior[5]. To further quantitative understanding of these nano‐scale processes and the morphology evolution in general gas‐metal reactions and thin film development, a powerful simulation tool is urgently needed. The Thin Film Oxidation (TFOx) model is an atomistic Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model, which has been developed of this purpose. The TFOx model includes all of the relevant microscopic processes in thin film growth. It simulates various steps and phenomenon during thin film development, which includes deposition, decomposition, adatom diffusion, nucleation, adatom desorption, island growth and et.al. TFOx has a large amount of input parameters compared to other KMC models to assure the realistic and accuracy, which also makes itself a versatile tool of studying the thin film development. Some application of TFOx in simulating the Cu (100) oxidation behavior will also be discussed in this paper.},

Therefore, KIMERA ensures to perform numerous studies with great versatility. In addition, it offers a good performance thanks to its parallelization and efficient algorithms within the KMC method. In this manuscript, we present the code features and show some examples of its capabilities.

	abstract = {Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations have emerged as a key tool for microkinetic modeling in heterogeneous catalysis and other materials applications. Systems, where site-specificity of all elementary reactions allows a mapping onto a lattice of discrete active sites, can be addressed within the particularly efficient lattice kMC approach. To this end we describe the versatile kmos software package, which offers a most user-friendly implementation, execution, and evaluation of lattice kMC models of arbitrary complexity in one- to three-dimensional lattice systems, involving multiple active sites in periodic or aperiodic arrangements, as well as site-resolved pairwise and higher-order lateral interactions. Conceptually, kmos achieves a maximum runtime performance which is essentially independent of lattice size by generating code for the efficiency-determining local update of available events that is optimized for a defined kMC model. For this model definition and the control of all runtime and evaluation aspects kmos offers a high-level application programming interface. Usage proceeds interactively, via scripts, or a graphical user interface, which visualizes the model geometry, the lattice occupations and rates of selected elementary reactions, while allowing on-the-fly changes of simulation parameters. We demonstrate the performance and scaling of kmos with the application to kMC models for surface catalytic processes, where for given operation conditions (temperature and partial pressures of all reactants) central simulation outcomes are catalytic activity and selectivities, surface composition, and mechanistic insight into the occurrence of individual elementary processes in the reaction network. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This review article is intended as a practical guide for newcomers to the field of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, and specifically to lattice KMC simulations as prevalently used for surface and interface applications. We will provide worked out examples using the kmos code, where we highlight the central approximations made in implementing a KMC model as well as possible pitfalls. This includes the mapping of the problem onto a lattice and the derivation of rate constant expressions for various elementary processes. Example KMC models will be presented within the application areas surface diffusion, crystal growth and heterogeneous catalysis, covering both transient and steady-state kinetics as well as the preparation of various initial states of the system. We highlight the sensitivity of KMC models to the elementary processes included, as well as to possible errors in the rate constants. For catalysis models in particular, a recurrent challenge is the occurrence of processes at very different timescales, e.g., fast diffusion processes and slow chemical reactions. We demonstrate how to overcome this timescale disparity problem using recently developed acceleration algorithms. Finally, we will discuss how to account for lateral interactions between the species adsorbed to the lattice, which can play an important role in all application areas covered here.},

	abstract = {Since its development in the 1970s, the rechargeable alkali-ion battery has proven to be a truly transformative technology, providing portable energy storage for devices ranging from small portable electronics to sizable electric vehicles. Here, we present a review of modern theoretical and computational approaches to the study and design of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials. Starting from fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics phenomenological equations, we rigorously derive the theoretical relationships for key battery properties, such as voltage, capacity, alkali diffusivity, and other electrochemically relevant computable quantities. We then present an overview of computational techniques for the study of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials, followed by a critical review of the literature applying these techniques to yield crucial insights into battery operation and performance. Finally, we provide perspectives on outstanding challenges and opportunities in the theory and computation of rechargeable alkali-ion battery materials.},

              Lithium and sodium (Na) mixed polyanion solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries display some of the highest ionic conductivities reported to date. However, the effect of polyanion mixing on the ion-transport properties is still not fully understood. Here, we focus on Na

Although NASICON is a widely investigated system, transport properties derived from experiments or theory vary by orders of magnitude. We use more than 2000 distinct ab initio-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to map the compositional space of NASICON over various time ranges, spatial resolutions and temperatures. Via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements on samples with different sodium content, we find that the highest ionic conductivity (i.e., about 0.165 S cm
